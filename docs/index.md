# A SIMD Image Manipulation Library

!!! warning
    This is a learning project and not yet meant for production use!

Apply [filters and effects](reference.md) on large amounts of texture data. Uses [SIMD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_instruction,_multiple_data) features on the device.

## Overview

It is a burdensome to write and maintain portable SIMD code. Code that is hand crafted (either via assembly or intrinsics) for X64 will need to be re-written for ARM. It is a goal to ensure that generated SIMD code targets as many platforms and SIMD variants as possible. Merle uses [Intel's Implicit SPMD Program Compiler (ISPC)](https://ispc.github.io/ispc.html) for this purpose. While it is likely that hand-tuned assembly will beat SIMD generated by tools like ISPC, the goal is to write easily vectorizable code that is portable.
